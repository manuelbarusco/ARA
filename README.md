# ARA

Acordar Reproducibility and Results Analysis (ARA) repository contains some Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of a reproducibility study conducted on the ACORDAR collection. The scripts analyze the results and informations obtained by parsing the collection with ADE and indexing and searching over it by using ARDFS. 

The repository structure is the following:
* <code>/files</code>: contains all the runs and runs scores that must be analyzed. It also contains some other useful input files for the analysis.  
* <code>/output</code>: it contains some output files that are produced during the analysis
* <code>/script</code>: it contains all the Jupyter Notebook for the run results analysis, collection analysis (duplicated and general purpose datasets) and qrels analysis.
